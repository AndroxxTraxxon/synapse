Developing a system mirroring StackStorm in Rust, with the stated enhancements and features, is an ambitious project. Here's a high-level roadmap to guide the development:

### 1. **Project Setup and Planning**
   - **Define System Architecture**: Outline the system's architecture, considering the modular design and features like Action, Workflow, Inquiry, etc.
   - **Technology Stack Selection**: Confirm the use of Rust and any other technologies or frameworks.
   - **Define Development Methodology**: Choose an agile methodology like Scrum or Kanban for iterative development.
   - **Initial Project Setup**: Set up the project repository, coding standards, and version control.

### 2. **Core System Development**
   - **Basic Framework Setup**: Develop the basic framework for the system, ensuring it's extensible and modular.
   - **Module Development**:
     - **Action Module**: Implement the execution logic for designated operations.
     - **Workflow Module**: Create the graph-based workflow system.
     - **Inquiry Module**: Develop the ask-and-respond mechanism for Workflows.
   - **Executor and Execution Tracking**: Implement Executor functionality and Execution tracking with state management.

### 3. **Sensor and Signal Implementation**
   - **Sensor Development**: Create mechanisms for detecting system events or external triggers.
   - **Signal Processing**: Develop the logic for emitting and handling signals from Sensors.

### 4. **Event and Rule Management**
   - **Event Handling**: Implement the system to identify and relay specific incidents.
   - **Rule Engine**: Develop the rule-based system to assess events and trigger corresponding actions.

### 5. **Security and Policy Enforcement**
   - **Implement Security Measures**: Ensure secrets are not passed via CLI parameters and establish secure communication channels.
   - **Policy Module**: Create policies to govern system operations, like execution limits.

### 6. **Interpreter-Agnosticism and Executor Flexibility**
   - **Multi-Interpreter Support**: Develop the capability to register and manage multiple executors of different types (e.g., Python, Node.js, binary executables).
   - **Version Compatibility**: Ensure the system can handle different versions of interpreters.

### 7. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - **Unit Testing**: Write extensive unit tests for each module.
   - **Integration Testing**: Test the integration of different modules.
   - **Performance Testing**: Assess system performance and optimize as needed.

### 8. **Documentation and Training**
   - **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the system.
   - **Developer Training**: Train the development team on system use and maintenance.

### 9. **Deployment and Scalability**
   - **Containerization**: Make the system container/cloud-native for easy deployment.
   - **Scalability Testing**: Test and ensure the system scales effectively in cloud-native environments.

### 10. **Feedback and Iterative Improvement**
   - **Beta Testing**: Release a beta version to select users and gather feedback.
   - **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously improve the system based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

### 11. **Final Release and Maintenance**
   - **Launch**: Officially release the complete system.
   - **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly update the system for security, compatibility, and performance.

This roadmap focuses on a phased, iterative approach, ensuring each component is well-developed and integrated while allowing for flexibility and adjustments based on ongoing testing and feedback.
